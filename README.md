# Few-Shot-Sampling
This repository contains the implementation of the sampling-procedure used in ["An Evaluation of Link Prediction Approaches in Few-Shot Scenarios"](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics12102296) published at MDPI 2023.
The given code generates a subset of a relational dataset by sampling a random entity from the given dataset and iteratively adding random neighbors to the subset. 
This procedure was used to generate few-shot datasets, on which the performance of different link-prediction approaches was evaluated.
